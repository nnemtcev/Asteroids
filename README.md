# Asteroids
A replica of the classic arcade game Asteroids, developed using vanilla JS and HTML5 Canvas.
# Implementation
* Object-oriented design with prototypal inheritance being implemented for moving objects, which inherit from the MovingObject class.
* Uses trigonometric functions to calculate random 2D vectors which are used for movement of moving objects.
* Collision detection is implemented using an algorithm with linear time complexity -- O(n), where n is the number of moving objects in total.
# Todo
* Fix shooting bullets.
* Replace circles with sprites.
